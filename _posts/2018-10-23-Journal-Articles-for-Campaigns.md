title: Journal Articles for Campaigns
---

This is a short post explaining my series of posts on new political science articles as they're helpful to running
data driven, research informed campaigns.

Briefly, the goal is to highlight what new papers I’m interested in as a campaign person, and which as a result might interest you. This is also an exercise for me in keeping up with the literature relevant to me. In that light, realize what I post about will most likely be skewed towards understanding political behavior and statistical methods.

In the interest of keeping things focused, anything with very direct, hands on applications to campaign work will always be at the top of these posts (think research on social pressure, or the effectiveness of a specific type of direct mail). That said, I also read for a broader understanding of political behavior, public opinion, and statistical tools, so those will make it into posts as well. In any case, I’ll include enough detail that you can decide for yourself if a deeper dive is worth it for you on a given paper.

Right now, I'm reading the following journals as they come out:
1. American Journal of Political Science
2. Quarterly Journal of Political Science
3. American Political Science Review
4. Political Analysis
5. Political Behavior
6. Journal of Experimental Political Science
7. Political Psychology
8. Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology
9. Public Opinion Quarterly

Although I have an interest in Machine Learning and NLP and follow NIPS, ICML, CoNLL, etc, there are enough people online blogging about those that I don't feel much need to cover them further. To the extent I post about machine learning, it's more 1 off posts, or short series presenting algorithms in ways I find helpful.
