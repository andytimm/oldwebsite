title: A Weak Learner Perspective on Boosting

For instance, Boosting can be understood as a special case
 of the [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_weight_update_method) algorithm, an answer to the question
 of whether many weak learners can be combined into a strong one, or as gradient descent in
function space, or as a margin maximizer, or as a way to very smoothly balance the bias-variance trade off.
