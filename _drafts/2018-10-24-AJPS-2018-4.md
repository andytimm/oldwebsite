This is the [American Journal of Political Science, Volume 62, Issue 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15405907/current), which came out October 19th. Happy GOTV!

You can find a description of this post series [here](2018-10-23-Journal-Articles-for-Campaigns.md). Briefly, the goal is to highlight what new papers I’m interested in as a campaign person, and which as a result might interest you.

**There isn't anything I found narrowly relevant to campaigns in this issue.** That said, there were papers that had excellent exploration of long term effects in politics. I particularly enjoyed Christopher
Ojeda's paper about the income-participation gap occurring at two points in an individual's life: not only current income, but income in childhood. Beyond that, [Soumyajit Mazumder](https://twitter.com/shom_mazumder?lang=en) found decent evidence of a long term effect on
democratic vote share in districts targeted by Civil Rights Movement, which is fascinating, even without claims about what the casual mechanism might be. I also looked at the Narcissism and Political Orientation piece and the workshop piece about Equivalence Approach to Balance/Placebo Tests.

Let's jump into these.

The Two Income Participation Gaps
-----
[Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12375). Here's the abstract:

>Scholars have long attributed the income‐participation gap—which is the observation that the rich participate in politics more than the poor—to income‐based differences in the resources, recruitment, mobilization, and psychology underpinning political behavior. I argue that these explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there are two income‐participation gaps: one based on current economic status and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies. The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps, that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their joint effect creates a larger income‐participation gap than estimated by prior research.

The other similar piece this reminded me of immediately was Yair Ghitza's [PhD thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8ZS2TT3), where he argues that people's political opinions are
formed most heavily in the 14-24(ish) age range, giving rise to rough generational groups like Eisenhower Republicans, Baby Boomers, or Reagan Conservatives in terms of partisan voting behavior. If this sort of development pattern could exist in formation of political opinion, it'd make sense that voting habits could develop early in life as well.

Ojeda argues this effect of economic status (current and historical) occurs through mediators like resources, mobilization, socialization, and psychology,

It'd be interesting to look at this problem using voter file data as well. While we only have 10 at best years of voter file data right now, in another decade studying trends like this with the aid of the voter file will be a lot of fun. You could probably even find something interesting already with the 10 year data, using census data when people register at 18 as an initial point .

Effect of Civil Rights Protests on Political Attitudes

Unlike in the first paper, Mazumder isn't making a particular casual claim here; mediators aren't the point. Instead, it's that the
