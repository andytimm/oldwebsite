This is the [American Journal of Political Science, Volume 62, Issue 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15405907/current), which came out October 19th. Happy GOTV!


You can find a description of this post series [here](2018-10-23-Journal-Articles-for-Campaigns.md). Briefly, the goal is to highlight what new papers I’m interested in as a campaign person, and which as a result might interest you.

**There isn't anything I found narrowly relevant to campaigns in this issue.** That said, there were papers that had excellent explorations of long term effects in politics. I particularly enjoyed Christopher
Ojeda's paper about the income-participation gap occurring at two points in an individual's life: not only current income, but income in childhood. Beyond that, [Soumyajit Mazumder](https://twitter.com/shom_mazumder?lang=en) found decent evidence of a long term effect on
democratic vote share in districts targeted by Civil Rights Movement, which is fascinating, even without claims about what the casual mechanism might be. I also looked at the Narcissism and Political Orientation piece and the workshop piece about Equivalence Approach to Balance/Placebo Tests.

Let's jump into these.

The Two Income Participation Gaps
-----

>Scholars have long attributed the income‐participation gap—which is the observation that the rich participate in politics more than the poor—to income‐based differences in the resources, recruitment, mobilization, and psychology underpinning political behavior. I argue that these explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there are two income‐participation gaps: one based on current economic status and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies. The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps, that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their joint effect creates a larger income‐participation gap than estimated by prior research.

Starting from a large body of research about how political attitudes develop ([Campbell 2006](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8326.html),[Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers 2009](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1017/S0022381609090719?mobileUi=0)), Ojeda starts with a great question: given so many important predictors of political participation like education are completed in early adulthood, why is the income participation gap studied by looking at only current income? The answer is mostly methodological, in the limitations of survey data, and he proceeds to do the best he can with available data.

To look for evidence of two separate income-participation gaps, he looks at 6 longitudinal studies, ranging from very short term surveys like NLSY79 that only have data for one election, to the GSS which he uses to look at most of the elections from 1972-2008. He tests two hypotheses- that there are two income gaps, and 

It'd be interesting to look at this problem using voter file data as well. While we only have 10ish years of voter file data right now, in another decade studying trends like this with the aid of the voter file will be a lot of fun. You could probably even find something interesting already with the 10 year data, using neighborhood income or similar census data when a voter registers at 18; I could see this being a useful method for predicting turnout, especially once

The other similar piece this reminded me of immediately was Yair Ghitza's [PhD thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8ZS2TT3), where he argues that people's political opinions are
formed most heavily in the 14-24(ish) age range, giving rise to rough generational groups like Eisenhower Republicans, Baby Boomers, or Reagan Conservatives in terms of partisan voting behavior. If this sort of development pattern could exist in formation of political opinion, it'd make sense that voting habits could develop early in life as well.

Effect of Civil Rights Protests on Political Attitudes

[Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12384). Here's the abstract:

>Protests can engender significant institutional change. Can protests also continue to shape a nation's contemporary politics outside of more formalized channels? I argue that social movements can not only beget institutional change, but also long‐run, attitudinal change. Using the case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks. These individual‐level results are politically meaningful—counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today. This study highlights how social movements can have persistent impacts on a nation's politics.



Unlike in the first paper, Mazumder isn't making a particular casual claim here; mediators aren't the point. Instead, it's that the
