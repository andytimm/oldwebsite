I'm a grad student at NYU Gallatin, studying political science and data science. I'm especially focused on quantitative methods that can help us run better campaigns, like using MRP to granularly model public opinion, field experiments to figure out what works best on the doors, and causal inference tools more broadly. Substantively, I'm interested in how white identity is becoming more politically salient, and quantifying the extent to which voting is habit forming. Before grad school, I was a field and data staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota. When not thinking about politics, I can most often be found running, reading, or playing chess.

My aim with this space is to show off some of my larger side projects, especially those that would benefit from some expository writing. I'll also include occasional career updates.
