I'm Andy. I'm a grad student at NYU Gallatin, studying political science and data science. I'm especially interested in quantitative methods that can help us run better campaigns, like MRP with survey data, field experiments, and causal inference tools more broadly. Before grad school, I was a field and data staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota.

My aim with this space is to show off some of my larger side projects, especially those that would benefit from some expository writing. I'll also include occasional career updates.
