I'm Andy. I'm a grad student at NYU Gallatin, studying political behavior and data science. Before grad school, I was a field and data campaign staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota.

My aim with this space is to show off some of my larger side projects, especially those that would benefit from some expository writing. I'll also include occasional career updates.
