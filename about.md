I'm Andy. Come fall, I'll be a grad student at NYU Gallatin, studying political behavior and data science. Before grad school, I was a field and data campaign staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota.

My aim with this blog is to accessibly describe some of the political campaign applications of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm also hoping to include some expository writing on statistical concepts I wish I'd had access to in my undergraduate career.
