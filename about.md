I'm a grad student at NYU Gallatin, studying political science and data science. I'm especially interested in quantitative methods that can help us run better campaigns, like using MRP to granularly model public opinion, field experiments to figure out what works best on the doors, and causal inference tools more broadly. Substantively, I'm interested in how white identity is becoming more politically salient, and how we can best measure it. Before grad school, I was a field and data staffer up and down the ballot in Minnesota.

My aim with this space is to show off some of my larger side projects, especially those that would benefit from some expository writing. I'll also include occasional career updates.
